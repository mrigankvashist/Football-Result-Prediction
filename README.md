# Football Result Predictor

The main objective of the project is to create a machine learning model which is
capable of predicting the results of a football match in terms of winning
probability at the half time by considering not only the goals scored by both
teams but also their historical performances and current table standings. I have created a flask app to depict the results for the same.
